This was a proof of concept tutorial level for a game I hope to eventually make. It's a stealth based platformer that has different endings based on how the game was played. I had followed a tutorial for most of this to learn how set things up in a better way that what I had done for adventure. I still ran into various different problems.
I had issues with colision and the player ending up on top of the map which I was able to fix. I also had issues with the enemy leaving the map as well. I fixed that issue too.

This was was my capstone project for getting my associates degree and I'm proud of howe it turned out. One oof my goals was also to produce an executable file out of the program which is in the level folder. the controlls are A and D to move, Space to jump. and arrow keys to move the yellow blocks. It was truly a blast to create this project.
